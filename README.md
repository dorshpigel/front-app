## About this App
```
This is a React.js/Typescript project which acts as a client for the DuckDuckGo proxy found here:
https://github.com/dorshpigel/micro-proxy

The proxy is a dependency of this project,meaning you should first initialize it and only then handle this client.
Follow the steps on the other repository and once you are done peform these:
1.Pull this project from this repository
2.run -> npm install
3.run -> npm start

assuming you performed all actions from the other repo as well,you should be good to go.

IMPORTANT:
The Nesjs proxy should be running on port 3100,and this client runs on port 3000.

Technical overview:
1.HTTP request management - axios.
2.UI packages - rsuite,@rsuite/icons
3.Aux packages - lodash,classnames
